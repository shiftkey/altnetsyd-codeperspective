# CodePerspective @ ALT.NET Sydney

I did a short presentation at ALT.NET Sydney on 28 June 2013 about CodePerspective.

I'll elaborate more on it later but the three key points:

 - it's a rather neat little tool
 - it's got some rough edges
 - I'd love to contribute to it but it's not easy to get started

I also mention SuperBenchmarker during the talk, which can be found [here](https://github.com/aliostad/SuperBenchmarker#readme)

More words coming soon
